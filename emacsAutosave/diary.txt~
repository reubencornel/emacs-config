Ok so finally here we are at the start of the year. I wanted to think
of a simple way to maintain my diary with out the hassle of compiling
it etc.

More in the next entry.

I spoke to Mom today. I managed to ask Mom an question I was dying to
ask for a while. I really wanted to know why did she not like
Vandy?. Well it so happens that she spoke to Monty Uncle when she was
in Hyderabad for Anand's wedding. There she asked him about his
opinion and he was like, she would not be right for the family, as she
could not stick to one guy. He also felt that Vandy was a pampered
brat and was a little self centered. I find that a bit surprising
considering the fact that she wants to contribute so much back.

I for one knew about the whole affair related with the other dude when
she was going around with Saurabh. I had my doubts about going ahead
with it but I went forward inspite of it. Which I believe was a
mistake. Anyway its good to have that issue cleared up.

But as I had my reasons for the whole thing. Primarily I did not see
her fitting in well at home. I don't know what it was, but then so
thats that. Interesting way to start the day,

So the idea for now is to get up early in the morning and head to the
library and get some work done. Guess thats about it.

I was reading up this entry from the art of manliness that dealt with
defining your values. This kind of reminded me about the fact that I
had to do the same. I believe I have listed the my values below in an
order I consider them important to my self.

* Discipline & Control: I believe I should have the discipline to
control and direct my thoughts and actions in ways that would help me
achieve my goals

* Family: To Be a caring brother and son to Becca, Mom and Dad

* Truth & Honesty: To always be honest and truthful about matters.

* Knowledge: To Read and acquire knowledge, to become a well rounded
  human being.

* Financial Security: To become financially secure by getting a job and
providing for Mom and Dad.

The point is that now that I have defined my core values how do I go
about achieving them. I think we have to take it one value at a time,
and record my progress as I go along. But at the same time review the
state of my other values so that I don't forget what I aim to achieve.

So for starters this is what I will be doing. First I will put down
these values into a text file and keep them displayed on my desktop
all the time. Doing that right now.

First I believe I have to work on my self discipline that I feel is
severely lacking and has been the cause for me not performing up to my
potential. I think one way to go about becoming disciplined is by
reading books and implementing what they say.

Guess so much for now.

Its very likely I will be flying to Seattle on the 10th. I will be
getting the confirmation for the same tomorrow. I also spoke to Mom
and there are a couple of things I told her today that I really
meant. Whenever I give the word they are free to go about and look for
a girl for me. 

That I believe would make me and everyone around me quite happy. 

Also today I have have been doing a few things to develop self
control. Primarily, I got up when the alarm went off, caught the bus
on time. Folded my clothes, did my bed, made dinner. I hope I can keep
up with this. 

I believe its just a matter of controlling your self on little things
then you can apply yourself to bigger things. I also spoke to Srinath
he will be back on the 10th that would be nice to have that dude back.

I also have begun to fall in love with the library, there are such
amazing books in there, and people around here have no clue about that
which is quite sad. I began reading a book about reading that was
quite affective. I have noted down the name of the book I must get a
copy of it sometime.

And for tomorrow, the plan is same, get to the library, move to
another floor and finish programming interviews exposed. I could not
do that task today because thats where I could not maintain my self
control. I believe I was reading too much of stuff that was not
relevant. I think before performing any action I have to remind my
self of 5 core values that I should maintain, Self control and
discipline, family, truth and honesty, knowledge and financial
security.

Guess thats about it.

Cheers,
Reuben
