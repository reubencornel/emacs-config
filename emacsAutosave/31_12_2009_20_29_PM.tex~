So here we are finally at the end of the year. All said and done this
has been a very eventful year. A whole lot of up and a few downs along
the way. It was a year where I was ecstatic about loving a girl and
down about having to break up with her. It was a year where I slogged
and finished my masters. It was a year that saw the beginning of my
group of friends moving apart. 

I have to say I had the most amazing start of the year. I was back home
having a lovely time with Mom, Dad and Becca. Being home is an amazing
experience, its all that love that I give and receive. It is a place
where I'm most comfortable, I know that I belong there. 

Perhaps one of the best things at that time was to go and meet Abba
who passed away this year. He was one person whom I admired most and
looked up to perhaps slightly more than Dad. I guessed it was perhaps
his wisdom that he gave away was what mattered. I feel a little sad
about it, but then also am glad he passed away cause he was in quite a
bit of pain. Going back to Mumbai is an experience in itself, for most
parts the number of people I meet always tends to become smaller and
smaller.

I flew back on the 19th of January. I hate going away from home, it
raises so many uncertainties. I don't know if I will see the people I
love again. On the flight I remember I met this chick Nitika. She was
doing her PhD in economics at Columbia. It was nice to have a partner
like her on the flight. It was quite nice. I remember seeing the
majestic glaciers of Greenland making their way towards the sea. That
was one crazy flight, we were delayed at Brussels because a flight
from Delhi came in late. As a result when I landed at JKF I stormed
through the air port as I did when I was leaving. In spite of my
sprint I missed my flight.

I eventually got back to Raleigh and it started snowing. It is so
pretty when it snows. Everything is white. Snow makes everything look
so pristine, pure, innocent. Ronsen, Fack and me went out for a photo
shoot where we made a couple of snow boobies. I like boobies!!

It was around that time that I actually noticed Kavya. I began to have
a crush on her, well that crush would not move to anything cause she
moved away. But then I don't know how interested she was in the whole
thing. But anyway that was an interesting affair. I loved the fact
that she was as cheerful as a Christmas tree. But before I could do
anything interesting she moved away to Atlanta. I called her up a
couple of time after that. She called me up for my birthday, that made
me feel quite nice. All nice things apart, she happens to be a little
silly. The funny thing about the whole thing was that I kept Vandy
informed all along, I never saw this going any where, but surprisingly
it did.

I have shown a couple of people my diary entries and Kavya was one
person. I wrote an entry about her I must say it was quite flattering,
or at least I thought it was quite flattering. I asked her to read it,
I remember her going red and redder, god that was fun. But then that
came to an end, I was down very down. I did find some stuff funny
about her primarily that she hated people who do their PhD. I had a
couple of fun escapades. She was significant in a way that she
introduced me to Lifford. 

Through the entire Kavya affair, I kept Vandy in the loop about what I
was doing. She was my go to person for everything related to
girls. She had broken up with her boy friend, she was just about
managing to get on with life. I told her to call me up any time she
felt like. As the days went on we started getting closer to each
other. We used to speak to each other forever, I never got tired
listening to her. I was there for her and she for me. She became the
closest thing to having a family in the US. I remember helping her out
on some stupid computer problem that she had, she was so, so thankful
to me. It looks like for some reason she was not treated right or
perhaps she did not have friends like me. But then we were getting to
be more than just friends. One day she asked me to ask her out and I
did :). Boy I actually had a girl friend. I wrote erotica for her, see
some of the earlier entries, it was hot and spicy stuff. She did write
a story for me. We used to talk about a whole lot of things, she had
quite an impact of the way I treat waste at home. I loved just
listening to her, the sound of her voice, it was the sweetest thing in
the world.

We had quite a wild time, she did a strip show for me once. She is one
of the most prettiest things I have seen naked: her breasts; her deep
brown and large nipples; the lovely birth mark next to her navel, that
I felt was the most sexiest thing of her. Well and I returned the
favour. Boy those were crazy times, we took a shower together
remotely. I wish I had her around I want to hug that girl so badly. I
thought I might end up marrying her and I wanted to too. She was
exactly the sort of woman I was looking for, she was as wild as a
stallion, but then she was as docile as a pussy. She was as strong as
a lion but also as delicate as a lily. She was the woman...

We ended up not in a nice way. God, that I guess is the worst thing I
believe I had to do. I told Mom that I was dating Vandy and she flared
up. She for some reason has always not liked Vandy too much. I don't
know what is it about Vandy that Mom does not like. It came down to
the point where Mom and Dad said that they would disown me. That was
the scary bit. Those few days, were I guess easily the worst few days
I have ever been through. But then I had to see it from two sides one
from mine, where I had a girl whom I loved more than anything and Mom
and Dad on the other side, they were people who I owed so much too. I
just could not ignore what they felt. I just called them up and
told them that I loved them. I know what Mom wants, she wants a nice
Mangalorean catholic girl. I can see that picture so clearly in my
head, I could not see her disappointed. I could not go on living with
my parents being disappointed. That said it came as a surprise that I
found Mom not to be as open, but then it was picture she had in her
head. Anyway so much for that, it was quite emotional for me to speak
to Mom and Dad and tell them I loved them...

I guess I grew a lot wiser, I figured out that religion is
required. You don't have to listen or do everything religion tells you
to do. I just realized that in a track called Lovers in Japan by cold
play there is a hidden song in there. But I figured out that religion
is one thing that I believe that should not be analyzed. People may
question that, but then religion does provides a sort of moral compass
by which we can align most of our values. 

It was in summer that I moved out of my apartment in Colonial Arms and
Parkas moved to New York. It was quite a crazy time, cleaning up the
apartment was the crazy thing. But then it was worth it cause we got
back quite a bit of our deposit. Parkas had quite a rough year. He
spoke to Sherley's parents about marrying her and that was not a
pleasant experience. After he came back, she broke up with him. He
almost became a wreck. He had to go to the psychologist at college for
a bit of therapy, but he got OK. Later, much later he realized that
she was cheating on him with some other dude. I guess she was not
worth it. He is better. I spoke to him sometime back and he was quite
thankful that we were around to support him. 

Come to think of it, its perhaps the most simplest things that make
all the difference to people. In this case, I was always around when
Parkas wanted to talk to me, or Vandy wanted to talk to me. It made a
whole lot of difference to them.

I also finished my Masters!!! Yes I did but in dramatic style. I
defended my thesis on the 3rd of November. I had to write a couple of
chapters in two weeks and boy I did it. Heck I'm glad that got done, I
learned quite a lot along the way. I learned how research is to be
done and I want to do more of it. I want to do a PhD sometime in the
future, right now I'm interested in the area of software
verification. The reason being that I love the fact that we can have
software that is robust as hell because of the work done in this
field.

I also interviewed with a couple of companies; salesforce.com and
amazon.com. I guess I got through almost all interviews at salesforce
and I have an onsite interview with amazon coming up. I guess that is
going to happen on the 11th of January.

Of late I have had a nasty feeling that for some reason I'm going to
meet Lifford's girl friend and perhaps not a ``friendly''
manner. Beats me why. But then its just a feeling.  Her name is
Jocelyn Rodrigues, she and Lifford have been going around for a few
months before they broke up or atleast thats what I believe. The
reason behind that was that Lifford was being too very intrusive, I
guess. From what I have heard from Lifford is that she is a very good
cook. As far as I'm concerned I want to know what she cooks.

Talking about cooking, I have earned the rightful place as the
``master chef'' around this place. I make some of the best food around
here. People cannot wait for me to cook. If I cook I know I can expect
atleast ten people in the house. I have taken cooking around here to
an all new level :D. I have a section of recipes on my website :).

Boy all in all it was a nice year. Had some ups, some downs, made some
amazingly hard decisions that I'm really happy about. All I hope for
is that I get a job this year and hopefully meet the girl whom I might
eventually want to spend my life with.

Now looking forward, this is what I want to achieve this
year. There are two main areas.

First on the personal front. I want to have Mom and Dad over for my
graduation. I know they will be here cause I know I will have a job by
then. I would like to meet the girl whom I believe I would like to
spend my life with. I also want to be home for christmas next year,
perhaps with the girl.

For a change I have some goals on the technical front. Firstly I want
to learn haskell and use it. Secondly I want to find an open source
project and contribute effectively to it.

Lets see if I can manage all this.

As usual I hope and wish everyone has lovely and a safe year
ahead and I cannot wait for it to come.
