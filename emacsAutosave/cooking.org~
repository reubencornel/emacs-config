* Leavening agents
** Natural leavening agents
*** Yeast
** Chemical Leavening agent
Used mainly for quick breads. Sometimes you add both baking soda and
baking powder, thats because you don't want as much leavening
*** Baking soda
Sodium bicarbonate
*** Baking powder
Baking soda + cream of tartar(Acid)
* Baking
** Quick breads
Chemically leavened
Classified on the way fat is mixed with dry stuff
*** Creaming method
cream cold fat into sugar
**** Brownies
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter melted 
1 tsp vanilla
2 eggs, beaten
1/2cup flour
1/3 cup cocoa
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2c nuts

Mix sugar and fat till light and fluffy, 
continue to cream the sugar and fat slowly and add the egg very slowly
make sure the egg is absorbed.

Add the dry mix
*** Biscuit method
Take cold fat and cut it into flower
**** Biscuit
-------
10 Oz flour
1/4 oz salt
1/2 oz sugar
1/2 oz baking powder
3 1/2 oz butter, cold chunks
6 oz cold milk (add in as much is required)

Mix flour + sugar + salt + baking powder + butter, object is to break the butter into small pea
pieces, we don't want it to be too fine.

add milk till the dough is sticky

Spread the flour, spread the dough to a reasonable size

**** Scones
1 cup flour
1 tbsp sugar
1tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, cold chunks
1/3 cup rasins
3 oz cold milk

mix dry ingredients and butter and make a pea sized meal

add milk to get a dough

add rasins

*** Muffin method
melt butter,

add liquid ingredients, add dry ingredients

batter is thinner, the blueberries are frozen, that prevents the
muffin from turning blue streaky muffins

Coat the blue berries with flour then add it into the batter
* Cakes
** Types of cakes
*** High fats cakes
**** Creaming methods - Shortened - Mix fat and sugar and eggs and flour and etc...90% of cakes
**** Two stage method - Bits of flour and liquid and mix it
*** Low fat cake - These use egg foam
**** Sponge
**** Angel food
**** Chiffon
** Essence of making cakes
*** Combining ingredients, trapping air and developing structure
*** The whole idea in mixing is trapping air in the cake
*** Too much mixing can cause curdling
** Problems in making cakes
*** Curdling issues
**** Wrong type fat: If it calls for shortening use butter
**** The fat is too cold. - Better imulsification
**** Mixing too quickly
**** Too much liquid
*** Cake Mixing
**** Forming Air cells - nice cake...fine texture, high speed mixing
**** Overmixing
*** Pre heat oven
**** Oven dial is lying
**** Correct baking 350-375 F,
***** if too hot hump in the middle, Protien sets before it leaven
***** If too cool it does not have volume.
**** When you take the cake out...let it cool for 15 mins
** Creaming method
*** Chocolate butter cake
*** Scale all ingredient by weight
**** 8 oz butter
**** 14 oz sugar
**** tsp salt
**** 4oz melted baking chocolate
**** 6oz whole eggs
**** 12 oz cake flour
**** 1/2 oz baking powder
**** 6 oz milk
**** 1/4 oz vanilla
*** Prep your pans first
**** Pan spray with flour, not with olive oil
*** mix Fat with sugar till its very light and smooth
*** Mix chocolate
*** In the slowest speed add eggs slowly watch it absorb
*** Once all the eggs have been absorbed
*** Add flour and milk and vanilla in slowly
*** Don't slam the cake down in the pan
*** 350 F
** Two Stage Method
*** Put the fat and dry ingredients
*** White Cake

* Poaching     :POACH:
Boiling 212 degrees, used only sphagetti, rice
185 - 205 simmer, most thing should be simmer
160 - 180 poach
protiens coagulate at 165 degrees

Can help incorporate flavour
**** salmon    :SALMON:

**** Chicken   :CHICKEN:
cold blanch, start item with cold water(broth), use for stock
hot blanch: start item with hot water(broth)
**** Vegetables 			   :VEGETABLES:VEGETABLE:ACID:ALKALI:
Cellulose and pectin give shape to vegetable
Acids will firm items, alkali will soften up stuff
* Professional cooking
** Effects of heat on foods
*** Carbohydrates
**** Found in
***** Starches and sugars
***** Found in fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, nuts
***** Meats and fish have a small amount too
**** Effects of heat
***** Caramelization: Browning of sugars, the ingredient gets a golden brown colour
***** Gelatenization: 
      Starches absorb water and swell, this priciple is used in
      thickening of sauces and production of breads and pastries

      Acids inhibit gelatinization, A sauce thickened with flour or
      starch will be thinner if it contains acid, that means be
      do not put in lime or things of acidic nature if you want the
      sauce to be thick.
*** Fruit and Vegetable fiber
**** Properties
     Gives structure and firmness to plants. Cannot be digested.
**** Effects of heat
     Breaks down fibers hence contributing to making vegetable soft
     when cooking
**** Effect of sugars
     Therefore fruit cooked in sugars keep shape better than those
     cooked with out sugar.
**** Effect of alkalis
     Baking soda and other alkalis make fibre softer, vegetables must
     not be cooked with baking soda because they become mushy and
     loose vitamins

*** Proteins
**** Found in
     Protiens are major component of meats, poultry, fish, eggs, milk
     and milk products, they are found in smaller quantities in beans,
     nuts and grains
**** Effects of heat
     The primary effect of heat on protiens results in
     coagulation. Protiens are essentially composed of amino
     acids. These form tight coils at the molecular level, as protiens
     are heated these unwind, at this point the protien is said to be
     *denatured*.

     The important thing for the cook is that once these amnio acids
     unwinds they attract each other and form bonds. This bonding is
     called coagulation. As the temperature increases they shrink and
     begin to loose moisture. Exposure to heat toughens them up, that
     explains why steaks get tougher after a certain temperature.

     Most protiens are cooked by 160 F. 

     Proteins also contain traces of Carbs, when the food product is
     heated the carbs and the proteins react, in what is known as the
     *Maillard reaction*, as a result meat products get that brown
     colour when they are heated. Ideally the temperature for this to
     happen is about 310F(154C)

     Connective tissues are special proteins that are present in
     meats. Meats with a lot of these tissues are generally tough,
     moist cooking and acids tenderize them.
   
**** Effects of acids
     They help speed up coagulation and dissolve some connective
     tissue, thats why when marinating stuff we add in things like
     lime, because it breaks down the connecting tissue.
 
*** Fats
**** Found in 
     meats, eggs, milk products, nuts, etc
     
**** Effect of heat
     Solid fats melt, as the temperature increases the fats begin to
     deteriorate rapidly and begin to smoke. This temperature is
     called the *smoke point*
** Heat Transfer
*** Conduction
*** Convection
    Stirring is a mechanical form of convection
*** Radiation
    There are two kinds of radiation used in the kitchen
**** Infrared Radiation
**** Microwave
     Because microware radiation affects only food with water, it
     would be useless against dry food items. Most microwaves penerate
     to only 2 inches within the food surface, after that heat is
     transferred through conduction with in the food.
** Cooking Methods
*** Moist heat methods
    Heat is conducted to the food through water or water based liquids
    such as stocks, sauces or steam.
**** Poach, Simmer, boil
     Means cooking a food item in water or a seasoned liquid
***** Boiling: Water at 212 degrees
      Mainly for vegetables and starches. The high temperature
      toughens protiens in meat and poultry products. It can break up
      delicate food items.
***** Simmer 185 to 205, 85C to 96C
      Most foods are cooked using this
***** Poach 160 to 180, 71 to 82
      This is used to cook fish and eggs with out the shell. It can
      also be used to remove undesirable flavouring from meat products.
***** Blanch
      Means to cook partially and briefly. There are two ways to do this
****** Place item in water and bring water to a boil and then cool item immedately
       Helps in dissolving blood, salt and other impurities
****** Place the item in boiling water for a while and then cool suddenly
       To set colour and destroy harmful emzymes. helps in loosening
       skins of tomatoes etc. 
**** Steam
***** Steaming
      The item is tightly wrapped so that it cooks in its own
      steam. This method is used in cooking items en papillote, that
      is the items are wrapped in paper/foil. Baked potatoes what are
      made by wrapping them in foil is actually steaming them.

      We have to be careful when using steam because although it is as
      hot as boiling water it carries more heat. Mainly used for
      cooking vegetables as it cooks them rapidly with out leaching
      away the nutrients.

      
*** Dry heat methods
    This when food is cooked with out water, such as through
    radiation, direct contact or cooking using hot fat.
