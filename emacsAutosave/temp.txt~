Introduction

Computer programming is an exact science, that is in theory we can
deduce the the properties of a program by applying pure deductive
logic. The aim of this paper is to clearly state the axioms that we
can apply when we reason about programs.

To expound what he is trying to describe he uses as a basis a
limited set of mathematical axioms based on positive integers or non
negative numbers. 

He argues that the most basic property of a program is whether or not
it executes what its user asks is to do.

Why am I so down?

1) I did not get into Microsoft, fully knowing that I could have gotten in
   2) Why did I not get in
      3) I believe I did not know my basics well enough
         4) Prepare the basics.

Now to define basics in my case...

1) Java
2) Databases
3) JSP/Servlets/AJAX
4) Basics of web services

Todos for today
* Finish creational patterns
  - summarize them
* Revise Databases
  - Normalization
  - Practice normalization problems.
  - Practice desiging a simple database and normalizing it.
