#+TITLE: A short history of nearly everything  - Bill Bryson
* A Short history of nearly everything

I was more than half way through when I started up on this book. Thats
the reason why start from Chapter 20 :). At the start I did not
realize why this book was titled so, because it covered very little
human history. But as I read further I realized that we humans have
spent very, very little time on earth. And the objective of the book
is to describe the part of time we don't see very often.

* Small World
   - Bacteria reproduce at am amazing rate, for example /Clostridium
     perfingens/ the bacteria responsible for gangrene reproduce in
     nine minutes whereas a human cell manages a division in about two
     days.
   - Bacteria are survivors they can be found almost everywhere even
     including the most hostile places imaginable, example boiling mud
     pots and even deep underground. Underground they survive by
     eating rocks and breathing things like minerals. Weird eh?
   - When conditions get bad bacteria can completely shutdown and
     reawaken when conditions get better.
   - *Typo in page 309: Last paragraph: it is supposed to be "been".*
   - *Carl Woese* was the guy who virtually redrew the biological tree
     of life. He was the person who figured out that there were more
     that 5 basic divisions in the tree. He redrew it so show about 23
     more division. This apparently has caused quite a bit of
     controversy. 
   - There are about ten million types of white blood cells in the
     human body. But they are not present in large quantities. When an
     antigen enters the body. And if a particular white cell
     identifies that antigen. It requests more blood cells of its
     type. When the body is generating the white blood cells is about
     the time when we feel sick. We begin to feel better when the
     white blood cells start acting.
   - There are two main ways how antigens evade white blood cells; one
     they use a quick hit and run approach and second they camouflage 
     themselves. The later approach is used by HIV.
   - Now I figured out why is swine flu so feared. Apparently there
     was an outbreak of swine flu, called the /Great Swine flu
     epidemic/ sometime around 1916 and it killed almost 21 million
     people in its first four months.
* Life goes on
   - Just for the record, fossils are compressed sediments that have
     replaces the original organic matter of the organism.
   - The cambrian age has been one of the greatest ages. This is the
     time where quite a bit of experimentation had been taking place.
   - *Charles Dolittle Walcott* was the person who discovered the
     Burgess Shale. Its discovery helped us identify how evolution
     carried out before the Cambrian Explosion. Walcott had a knack
     for finding fossils. He was self taught, he was offered a job at
     the US national survey, which he eventually went on to head. He
     was the person who founded the National Advisory Committee on
     Aeronautics that would later become NASA. He also served as the
     secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Brilliant guy.
   - The cambrian explosion as explained by the book as being an
     explosion where all of a sudden the organisms increased in
     size. The book rationalizes the reason for not finding any other
     sort of organisms is that they were too small to be preserved.
* Good bye to all that
   - Life is an odd thing. It couldn't wait to get going, but then,
     haven gotten going it seemed in very little hurry to move on.
   - The author uses the examples of lichens to show that life as
     such can exist only for itself. It does not need to have
     ambition, it just goes on.
     - On a side note, lichens are partnership between fungi and
       algae. The fungi excrete acids that dissolve rocks hence
       releasing minerals, the algae convert into food to sustain
       both. 
   - The point is that being human we always tend to believe that life
     needs to have ambition, there has to be a point to the whole
     thing. But somehow we fail to look at examples like this.
   - I really loved the following passage from the book and have
     copied it down here.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   IT is easy to overlook this thought that life just is. As humans we are
   inclined to feel that life must have a point. We have plans and
   aspirations and desires. We want to take constant advantage of all the
   intoxicating existence we've been endowed wit. But what's life to a
   lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as
   ours -- arguably even stronger. If I were told that I had to spend a
   decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would
   lose the will to go on. Lichens don't. Like virtually all living
   things they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a
   moment's additional existence. Life, in short, just wants to be. But -
   and here an interesting point -- for most part it doesn't want to be
   much.
   
   This is perhaps a little odd because life has had plenty of time to
   develop ambitions. If you imagine 4.5 billion odd years of Earth's
   history compressed into a normal earthly day, then life begins very
   early, about 4 AM, with the rise of the fist simple, singled celled
   organisms, but then advances no further for the next sixteen
   hours. Not until almost 8:30 in the evening, with the day five-sixths
   over, has Earth anything to show the universe but a restless skin of
   microbes. Then, finally, the first sea plans appear, followed twenty
   minutes later by the first jelly fish and the enigmatic Ediacaran
   fauna first seen by Reginald Sprigg in Australia. At 9:04 PM
   trilobites swim onto the scene, followed more or less immediately by
   the shapely creatures of Burgess shale. Just before 10 PM plants
   begin to pop up on land. Soon after, with less than two hours left in
   the day the first land creatures follow. 
   
   Thanks to ten minutes or so of balmy weather, by 10:24 the Earth is
   covered in the great carboniferous forests whose residues give us all
   our coal, and the first winged insects are evident. Dinosaurs
   plod on to the scene just before 11 PM and hold sway for about
   three-quarters of an hour. At twenty-one minutes to midnight they
   vanish and the age of mammals begins. /Humans emerge one minute and
   seventeen seconds before midnight/. The whole of our recorded history,
   on this scale would be no more than a few seconds, a single human
   lifetime barely an instant. Throughout this greatly speeded up day
   continents slide about and bang together at a clip that seems
   positively reckless. Mountains rise and melt away, ocean basins come
   and go, ice sheets advance and withdraw.  And throughout the whole,
   about three times every minute, somewhere on the planet there is a
   flash-bulb pop of light marking the impact of a Manson sized meteor or
   one even larger. Its a wonder that anything at all can survive in such
   a pummeled and unsettled environment. In fact, not many things do for long
