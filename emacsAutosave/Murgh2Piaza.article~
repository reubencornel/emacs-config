* Murgh Do Piaza

This is an absolutely simple, scrumptious mughalai chicken recipe. This recipe is quite easily available of the net but I have made a minor modification to make it a bit richer.

** Ingredients

1 pound Chicken pieces serving size<br />
1 and 1/2  pound onions peeled<br />
1 inch cube of ginger finely chopped, 
4 cloves garlic finely chopped. I substituted with 1 and 1/4 tsp of garlic ginger paste.<br />
1 tsp coriander powder<br />
1 tsp cumin powder<br />
1/2 tsp turmeric powder<br />
1 tsp red chili powder<br />
1/2 tsp garam masala powder<br />
1 bay leaves<br />
1/2 cup yogurt<br />
2 medium tomatoes finely chopped<br />
Salt to taste<br />
1/4 cup cooking oil / ghee<br />
1 tbsp fresh cilantro finely chopped<br />
2 tbsp lemon juice<br />
2 tbsp heavy cream<br />

** Method

Add red chili, coriander, turmeric, cumin, garam masala powders; yogurt and salt to the chicken and mix well to coat the chicken pieces and keep aside for about an hour.

Finely slice 2 onions and roughly chop the rest of the onions.

Lightly grease a heavy based sauce pan with 1 tablespoon of oil. Spread half of the chopped onions on the bottom. Add the chicken pieces and layer the rest of the chopped onions on top.

Cover pan with a tight fitting lid. Cook for 20-25 minutes on slow fire until the onions are reduced to a pulp and the chicken is tender. At this stage liquid almost dries up. If some liquid is still there cook it on medium heat without lid till liquid evaporates.

Heat oil/ghee in another pan. Add bay leaves, sliced onions, ginger and garlic, stirring frequently fry for 8-10 minutes to a crisp golden color.

Mix in tomatoes and stir fry until the tomatoes are reduced to a pulp and ghee separates.

Stir in chicken and onions. Mix all the ingredients well fry the mixture until it is well browned and a thick onion sauce has formed.

Add heavy cream, lemon juice and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.

Serve hot with Naan or Paratha

Remember, do not add water at any stage or you will ruin the dish. A "Do Piaza" cooks in its own juices.
