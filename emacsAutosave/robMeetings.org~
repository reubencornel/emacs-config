** Explain new proof of concept idea
*** Explain how I plan to implement it
**** I have Data structure to represent crossword
**** Build a module around it
**** Write a model for that
*** Explain reason for selecting idea
**** Use of wordnet
**** Perhaps use of constraint solving
** Show the Data structure
*** Demo it
** Show the work on the module
** Ask for help as to how to design chunks
** Give brief idea about framework for
** Ask about funding if possible

** will most likely be defending in the summer then do I have to maintain status
for fall?

I would have to register for CSC 696 for the summer 2. In the worst for fall register for 699 with reduced course load

** When do I have to submit my plan of work?
* <2009-07-08 Wed 13:51>
** Show progress on the model
** Talk about the thesis document
Introduction 
 Two to three pages
 What am I providing and how people can use it.

** Section 1.3 seems reasonable
**** Sample system
*** ADD SECTION Cognitive modelling programming environment
**** Architectures
**** Programming environment for the architecture(indivdual/collab)
**** Things that might help make this architectures support collaboration
***** Example - summerschools, models
*** Collaboration
*** System GET A NAME
**** Requirements
**** Design
*** Evaluation (proof of concept)
*** Benefits
*** At the end revisit contributions.
***** Talk Online communities, eg facebook, myspace
***** TODO Lookup second life
** Talk about the coding project
*** Deadline?? - middle of next week, java
*** Font using image glyph

The theory could be intractable. We might imagine a theory of cognition that requires more storage than exists in exiting systems
and runs too slowly.

Categorization: one interpretation is that in act-r and soar and sak them to try to model some cog behav done by humans lke problem solving
if we try to model behaveious morel od people given somple choices like

1) Liek three objects
   1) Thtree tory
      1) Bed
	 2) Doll
	    3) Dog 
   not same size

   Which are are similar
