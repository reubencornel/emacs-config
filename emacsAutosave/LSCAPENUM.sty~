Subject: 	Re: Rotating page with page number
	


Hello,

I thought I'd reply to myself with the solution I've found to rotating
pages with the margins and page number. It isn't pretty, but it gets
the job done (at least I haven't found any problems with it yet). The
following is a mix of latex and pseudo-code:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\usepackage{pdflscape}
\usepackage{changepage}
\usepackage{rotating}

%% A new environment to rotate page, margins, and page number
\newenvironment{lscapenum}
{
\clearpage
\changepage{%insert appropriate changes here, see changepage docs%}
\begin{landscape}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhead{} % clear all header fields
\fancyfoot{} % clear all footer fields
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0pt}
\rfoot{
% Since the header and footer are unrotated, we must manually
% place the page number. The picture environment is included
in
% standard LaTeX.
\setlength{\unitlength}{\textheight}
\begin{picture}(0,0)
\put(%xshift%,%yshift%){\begin{sideways}\thepage\end
{sideways}}
\end{picture}
}
}
{
\end{landscape}
% The \textheight is too large leaving landscape environment
% since we invoked the \changepage. We manually reduce it.
\addtolength{\textheight}{-\myoldfootskip}

% \textheight controls 3 other variables, which must be updated.
% See \endlandscape definition in lscape.sty
\global\@colht=\textheight
\global\vsize=\textheight
\global\@colroom=\textheight

\pagestyle{plain}
}
